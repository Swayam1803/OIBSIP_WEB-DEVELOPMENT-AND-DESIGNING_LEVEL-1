                Developed a full-stack web application to manage and
                display upcoming workshops and collect participant
                feedback.
                Built front-end using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, where
                users can view scheduled upcoming workshops and
                provide feedback on attended sessions through a user
                friendly interface.
                Implemented back-end using MongoDB to store workshop
                details and feedback data.
                Designed features including adding new workshops, listing
                upcoming events, feedback submission and ensuring
                seamless data storage and retrieval.
                Demonstrated skills in web development, form handling,
                database schema design, and full-stack integration
                between front-end and data storage.
                Project helped to simulate a real-world workshop
                management facilitating easy addition of new workshops
                and collection of feedback</p>
